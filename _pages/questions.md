# QUESTIONS

**What is The Sugawara Collective?** \\
The Sugawara Collective is a group of fans of the Haikyuu!! character Sugawara Koushi, Karasunoâ€™s vice-captain and third-year setter. Through the collective, we will host digital zine projects, spotlights, send newsletters, etc.


**Is there an age limit to join the collective?** \\
Yes. Members of the server and participants in any event must be at least 18 years or older. This restriction is to protect all of our collective members. If anyone is caught lying about their aged, they will be removed from the collective and barred from participating in any future events or projects.


**Does joining the server mean I have to participate in events?** \\
Not at all! We want to server to be a comfortable and safe place for all of the Haikyuu fandom community. If you want to pop it to work on writing, get a fic rec, or simply chat, you are welcome to do so.


**Still have questions?** You can reach out to us in our questions channel in Discord, via our DMs on Twitter, or through our questions via our Tumblr.
