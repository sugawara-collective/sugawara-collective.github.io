# Join the Collective


## Discord Server

We offer a discord server with various channels and resources. Please note the rules of the server.

1. Please be respectful! Racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and other kinds of discrimination will not be tolerated. If you are having issues with someone, please contact the person and discuss it privately or contact a mod. This is a safe space.

2. This is an 18+ server. If we find out anyone has lied about their age in order to gain access, they will promptly be banned. 

3. This server will contain several zines/projects related to Suga! As such, there will be various Suga ships and background ships featured and talked about! Hate towards any ship will not be tolerated. If you do not enjoy a particular ship being discussed, feel free to temporarily mute the channel in which the discussion is taking place.

4. There are NSFW channels for adults who would like access to those channels. These channels will be opt-in using self-assigned roles in the server. 

5. Please censor spoilers or anything that may be potentially triggering. To do this, you just need to put two lines around your censored text, like so: \|\| your text \|\|. Include CW/TW before the text as well so people will understand what they're clicking.

6. Please respect your fellow contributors and server members. We really encourage people to share whatever they're working on, whether for one of the collectiveâ€™s projects, other fan works, or real life projects! We want to foster good creative energy and to motivate each other! Do not give critique or negative feedback unless it is explicitly stated that it is welcome.


We are trying to live a drama-free life, so do not bring unnecessary stress to the projects. Our hope is that we can make new friends and create beautiful projects to be proud of!
