      <i>Weather is not Sugaâ€™s friend, except when it is.</i><br/><br/>
      Suga has three brief connections with strangers due to mishaps with mother nature. Afterwards, he hopes that fate will bring at least one of them back into his life. He ends up getting a bit more than he bargained for, but Suga has no reason to complain.
